# python-api-challenge

### *Important Note*
This project does not contain the VacationPy portion of the assignment due to our instructor advising to skip it because of issues with gmaps. Further explanation is in the markdown of WeatherPy.

### Description:
* This project contains Jupyter Notebook code, an output data folder, a gitignore file, and a README file.
* The output data folder contains the csv file with the exported data from the Jupyter Notebook and 4 png files with the exported plots from the Jupyter Notebook.
